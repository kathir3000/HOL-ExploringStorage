<a name="Overview" />
## Overview ##

Storage services provide persistent, durable storage in the Windows Azure compute emulator, and include blob and table service and the queue service. In addition, using Windows Azure Drives, your Windows Azure applications running in the cloud can use existing NTFS APIs to access a durable drive backed by blob storage.
In this lab, you will examine the basic process of working with Windows Azure storage on the local compute emulator, and explore some of the features that are available to developers.

Every predefined collection is designed to match a particular development style and determines window layouts, editor behavior, IntelliSense code snippets, and dialog box options. The procedures in this lab describe the actions necessary to accomplish a given task in Visual Studio when using the **General Development Settings** collection. If you choose a different settings collection for your development environment, there may be differences in these procedures that you need to take into account.

<a name="Exercise1" />
### Exercise 1: Working with Tables ###

In this exercise, you use the Windows Azure Table Service API to create a simple application that stores and retrieves data in structured storage. It consists of a simple chat Web application that can save, retrieve and display messages stored in a Windows Azure table.

Windows Azure tables store data as collections of entities. Entities are similar to rows. An entity has a primary key and a set of properties. A property is a name/value pair, similar to a column.

To access Windows Azure Table Service, you use a REST API that is compatible with [WCF Data Services][5] (formerly ADO.NET Data Services Framework). This exercise uses the [WCF Data Services Client Library][6] (formerly .NET Client Library) to read and write data to table service.

**Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString**: This is the connection string to Windows Azure server, same as _DataConnectionString_, however this one is dedicated for logging diagnostics.

<a name="Ex1Task2" />
#### Task 2 - Creating Classes to Model the Table Schema ####

When working locally against the Storage Emulator service for Table Service, you use WCF Data Services client library.

To use Windows Azure table service in .NET, you construct a class that models the desired schema. In addition to the properties required by your model, the class must include a **Timestamp**, a **PartitionKey** and a **RowKey** property and it must be decorated with a **DataServiceKey**(_"PartitionKey"_, _"RowKey"_) custom attribute. To simplify this, the **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient** namespace includes a **TableServiceEntity** class that already defines the mandatory properties and attributes and can easily be derived from in your class.

In this task, you create the model where the data is stored for the Chat application.

1. Add a reference to the WCF Data Services client library to the Web role project. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **RdChat_WebRole** project node and select **Add Reference**. In the **.NET** tab, select the **System.Data.Services.Client** assembly and click **OK**.

1. Add a class to the Web role project to model the message table. To do this, in **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **RdChat_WebRole** project node, point to **Add** and select **Class**. In the **Add New Item** dialog, set the **Name** to **Message.cs** and then click **Add**.

1. Update the declaration of the Message class to derive from the **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient.TableServiceEntity** class. 

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex1-01-MessageClass-CS_)
	<!--mark: 2-->
	````C#
	public class Message 
	    : Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient.TableServiceEntity
	{
	}	
	````

	> **Note:** The **TableServiceEntity** class is included as part of the **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient** library. It defines the **PartititionKey, RowKey** and **TimeStamp** system properties required by every entity stored in a Windows Azure table.
Together, the **PartitionKey** and **RowKey** define the **DataServiceKey** that uniquely identifies every entity within a table.

1. Add a default constructor to the **Message** class that initializes its **PartitionKey** and **RowKey** properties.

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex1-02-MessageConstructor-CS_)
	<!--mark: 1-5-->
	````C#
	public Message()
	{
	  PartitionKey = "a";
	  RowKey = string.Format("{0:10}_{1}", DateTime.MaxValue.Ticks - DateTime.Now.Ticks, Guid.NewGuid());
	}
	````

	> **Note:** For the purposes of this exercise, you assign a fixed value to the **PartitionKey** property. In a more realistic scenario, you would choose a value that ensures load balancing across storage nodes.


1. Add two string properties to the **Message** class, **Name** and **Body**, to hold information about the chat message.

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex1-03-TableSchemaProperties-CS_)
	<!--mark: 1,3-->
	````C#
	public string Name { get; set; }
	
	public string Body { get; set; }
	````
	
1. Save the **Message.cs** file.
1. Next, add a class to the Web role project to define the WCF Data Services **DataServiceContext** required to access the Messages table. To do this, in **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **RdChat_WebRole** project node, point to **Add** and select **Class**. In the **Add New Item** dialog, set the **Name** to **MessageDataServiceContext.cs** and then click **Add**.
1. In the new class file, add the following using namespace directives.

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex1-04-Namespace-CS_)
	<!--mark: 1,2-->
	````C#
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure;
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient;
	````

1. Replace the declaration of the new class to derive from the **TableServiceContext** class and include a default constructor to initialize the base class with the storage account information.
	
	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex1-05-MessageDataServiceContextClass-CS_)
	<!--mark: 3-10-->
	````C#
	namespace RdChat_WebRole
	{
	  public class MessageDataServiceContext
	      : TableServiceContext
	  {
	    public MessageDataServiceContext(string baseAddress, StorageCredentials credentials)
	        : base(baseAddress, credentials)
	    {
	    }
	  }
	}
	````
1. Now, add a property to the **MessageDataServiceContext** class to return a data service query for the Messages table. 

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex1-06-MessagesProperty-CS_)
	<!--mark: 5-11-->
	````C#
	public class MessageDataServiceContext
	    : TableServiceContext
	{
	  ...
	  public IQueryable<Message> Messages
	  {
	    get
	    {
	      return this.CreateQuery<Message>("Messages");
	    }
	  }
	}
	````
	
1. Finally, add a method to the **MessageDataServiceContext** class to insert new messages into the table. You will use this method later when implementing the chat functionality.

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex1-07-AddMessageMethod-CS_)
	<!--mark: 5-9-->
	````C#
	public class MessageDataServiceContext
		: TableServiceContext
	{
	  ...
	  public void AddMessage(string name, string body)
	  {
		this.AddObject("Messages", new Message { Name = name, Body = body });
		this.SaveChanges();
	  }
	}
	````
	
1. In the Build menu, select Build Solution.

<a name="Ex1Task3" />
#### Task 3 – Creating the Chat User Interface ####

In this task, you add the code necessary to store messages in a Windows Azure table and display them on the Web page.

1. Locate the **Application_Start** method in **Global.asax.cs** file and insert the following code (shown in **bold**) into it. This creates storage tables from **MessageDataServiceContext** that we created earlier.

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex1-08-ApplicationStartMethod-CS_)

	<!--mark: 4-13-->
	````C#
	protected void Application_Start()
	{
	  ...
	  /// Create data table from MessageDataServiceContext
	  /// It is recommended the data tables should be only created once. It is typically done as a 
	  /// provisioning step and rarely in application code.
	  var account = CloudStorageAccount.FromConfigurationSetting("DataConnectionString");
	
	  // dynamically create the tables
	  CloudTableClient.CreateTablesFromModel(
	  	  typeof(MessageDataServiceContext),
	  	  account.TableEndpoint.AbsoluteUri,
	  	  account.Credentials);
	}
	````

	> **Note:** The code shown above creates the required tables from the model defined by the **MessageDataServiceContext** class created earlier. 
	Note that the recommendation is that data tables should only be created once. Typically, you would do this during a provisioning step and rarely in application code. The **Application_Start** method in the **Global** class is a recommended place for this initialization logic.
	To retrieve and display messages, the method creates an instance of the **MessageDataServiceContext** class and initializes it from account information available in the service configuration file (**ServiceConfiguration.cscfg**). It binds the **Messages** property, which returns a data service query for th_e Messages_ table, to a **ListView** control on the page for display. 
	Objects of type **CloudStorageAccount** represent a storage account, which contains the settings required to make a connection to the Storage Service.  Associated with a storage account are the account name, the URI of the account and a shared key, which the **CloudTableClient** helper class uses for its initialization. These settings are obtained from **ServiceConfiguration.cscfg**.

1. Make sure the following namespace directives exist at the top of the **Global.asax.cs** code file. They are for the utility storage classes and for the **ServiceRuntime** classes.

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex1-09-GlobalNamespace-CS_)
	<!--mark: 1-3-->
	````C#
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure;
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime;
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient;
	````
	
1. Expand the **RDChat_WebRole** node in **Solution Explorer**, then right-click **Default.aspx** and **select View** Code to open the code-behind file for the Web page that contains the UI for the chat application.

	Make sure the following namespace directives are included in the **Default.aspx.cs** code-behind file.

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex1-10-Namespace-CS_)
	<!--mark: 1,2-->
	````C#
	using System.Data.Services.Client;
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure;
	````
	
1. Locate the **SubmitButton_Click** event handler in **Default.aspx.cs** and insert the following code (shown in **bold**) into the method body to save messages entered by the user to the Table Service, then data bind messages from Table Service to the page. The method uses the **AddMessage** method, which you created earlier in the lab, to insert a new **Message** entity into the table. 

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex1-11-SubmitButtonClick-CS_)
	<!--mark: 3-21-->	
	````C#
	protected void SubmitButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
		{
		  var statusMessage = string.Empty;
		
		  try
		  {
			var account = CloudStorageAccount.FromConfigurationSetting("DataConnectionString");
			var context = new MessageDataServiceContext(account.TableEndpoint.ToString(), account.Credentials);
		
			context.AddMessage(HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(this.nameBox.Text), HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(this.messageBox.Text));
		
			this.messageList.DataSource = context.Messages;
			this.messageList.DataBind();
		  }
		  catch (DataServiceRequestException ex)
		  {
		   statusMessage = "Unable to connect to the table storage server. Please check that the service is running.<br>"
							+ ex.Message;
		   }
		
		   this.status.Text = statusMessage;
		}
	````

1. Save the all files and select **Build Solution** from the **Build** menu.

<a name="Ex1Verification" />
#### Verification ####

To test your service running in the Compute Emulator:

1. In Visual Studio, press **F5** to build and run the application. The compute emulator starts and a new deployment containing the **RdChat** Web Role initializes. A browser window opens to display the Windows Azure Chat Web page.

### Exercise 2: Working with Blobs ###

In this exercise, you will use the Windows Azure Blob Service API to create an application that saves and retrieves image data stored as blobs in Windows Azure storage. It consists of a simple image gallery Web site that can display, upload and remove images in Windows Azure storage, and allows you to enter and display related metadata. The application uses a single container to store its image content as blobs.

When you create a blob in Windows Azure, you associate a content type that specifies the format in which the API returns it and allows you to retrieve an image directly from the URL of the corresponding blob.

<a name="Ex2Task1" />
#### Task 1 – Retrieving Blob Data from Storage ####

In this task, you will create an image gallery web page to display images retrieved from Windows Azure storage. The provided solution consists of a web site project with a single page that contains the elements required to display images and enter metadata.  You will add the necessary functionality by editing the code-behind file.

1. Open Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 elevated as **Administrator** from **Start | All Programs | Microsoft Visual Studio 2010** by right-clicking **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010** and choosing **Run as administrator**.

1. In the **File** menu, choose **Open** and then **Project/Solution**. In the **Open Project** dialog, browse to **\\Source\\Ex2-WorkingWithBlobs\\begin** and open the **begin.sln** file.

1. Update the service definition to define the configuration settings required to access Windows Azure Table service.  To do this, expand the Roles folder of the **RDImageGallery** project in **Solution Explorer**, right-click **RDImageGallery_WebRole**, and then select **Properties**.

	![Setting role configuration settings](images/setting-role-configuration-settings.png?raw=true)

	_Setting role configuration settings_
	
1. In the **Settings** tab, click **Add Setting** and create a **ConnectionString** type named _DataConnectionString_. Click the button labeled with an ellipsis and set the connection string to **Use storage emulator**.

1. Add another setting named _ContainerName_ and set its value to _gallery_.

	![Creating a setting for the container name](images/creating-a-setting-for-the-container-name.png?raw=true)
	
	_Creating a setting for the container name_
	
	> **Note:** The container name must be a valid Domain Name System (DNS) name, conforming to the following naming rules:
	>
	> - Must start with a letter or number, and can contain only letters, numbers, and dash (-) characters.
	> - All letters must be lowercase.
	> - Must be from 3 to 63 characters long.
	> - A name cannot contain a dash next to a period.

1. Expand the **RDImageGallery_WebRole** node in **Solution Explorer**, then right-click **Default.aspx** and select **View Code** to open the code-behind file for the user interface of the image gallery. In the next steps, you will modify this file to add some of the required functionality.

1. Make sure the following namespace directives exist at the top of the code file. They are for the utility storage classes and for the **ServiceRuntime** classes.
	
	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex2-01-Namespace-CS_)
	<!--mark: 1-4-->
	````C#
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure;
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime;
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient;
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient.Protocol;
	````
	
1. For this lab, you need to store the blobs in a public container, so they are visible on the web to normal, anonymous users.  In this step, you will ensure that the container specified in **ServiceConfiguration.cscfg** exists. To do this, add the following method at the bottom of the **_Default** class.

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex2-02-EnsureContainerExistsMethod-CS_)
	<!--mark: 4-12-->
	````C#
	public partial class _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
	{
	  ...
	  private void EnsureContainerExists()
	  {
	    var container = this.GetContainer();
	    container.CreateIfNotExist();
	
	    var permissions = container.GetPermissions();
	    permissions.PublicAccess = BlobContainerPublicAccessType.Container;
	    container.SetPermissions(permissions);
	  }
	}
	````
	
1. Next, you will create a utility method to retrieve a reference to the container created by the code in the previous step.  This method will be called in almost all operations since the container is involved with all blob operations. Add a method to create the container at the bottom of the **_Default** class. This method uses the configuration settings you entered in earlier steps.

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex2-03-GetContainerMethod-CS_)
	<!--mark: 4-11-->
	````C#
	public partial class _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
	{
	  ...
	  private CloudBlobContainer GetContainer()
	  {
	    // Get a handle on account, create a blob service client and get container proxy
	    var account = CloudStorageAccount.FromConfigurationSetting("DataConnectionString");
	    var client = account.CreateCloudBlobClient();
	
	    return client.GetContainerReference(RoleEnvironment.GetConfigurationSettingValue("ContainerName"));
	  }
	}
	````
	
1. Insert the following code (shown in **bold**) in the **Page_Load** method to initialize the container and refresh the **asp:ListView** control on the page that displays the images retrieved from storage.

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex2-04-PageLoadMethod-CS_)
	<!--mark: 6-27-->
	````C#

	    {
	      if (!IsPostBack)
	      {
	        this.EnsureContainerExists();
	      }
	      
	      this.RefreshGallery();
	    }
	    catch (System.Net.WebException we)
	    {
	      this.status.Text = "Network error: " + we.Message;
	      if (we.Status == System.Net.WebExceptionStatus.ConnectFailure)
	      {
	        this.status.Text += "<br />Please check if the blob service is running at " +
	        ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["storageEndpoint"];
	      }
	    }
	    catch (StorageException se)
	    {
	      Console.WriteLine("Storage service error: " + se.Message);
	    }
	  }
	  ...
	}
	````
	
1. Add the following method at the bottom of the **_Default** class to bind the images control to the list of blobs available in the image gallery container. The code uses the **ListBlobs** method in the **CloudBlobContainer** object to retrieve a collection of **IListBlobItem** objects that contain information about each of the blobs. The images **asp:ListView** control in the page binds to these objects to display their value.

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex2-05-RefreshGalleryMethod-CS_)
	<!--mark: 4-13-->
	````C#

	  {
	    this.images.DataSource =
	      this.GetContainer().ListBlobs(new BlobRequestOptions()
	      {
	        UseFlatBlobListing = true,
	        BlobListingDetails = BlobListingDetails.All
	      });
	    this.images.DataBind();
	  }
	}
	````
	
1. Press **F5** to build and run the application. A browser window launches and displays the contents of the image gallery. Note that at this point, the container is empty and the list view displays a “No Data Available” message. In the next task, you will implement the functionality required to store images as blobs in Windows Azure storage.

In this task, you add functionality to the image gallery Web page to enter metadata and upload image files to Windows Azure storage. The page contains text controls that you can use to enter descriptive metadata for the selected image. An **asp:FileUpload** control on the page retrieves images from disk and posts them to the page, where they are stored in blob storage.

1. Open the **Default.aspx.cs** file in the Visual Studio text editor. To do this, right-click the **Default.aspx** file in Solution Explorer and select **View Code**.

1. Add a method at the bottom of the page to save images and their metadata as blobs in Windows Azure storage. The method uses the **GetBlobReference** method in the **CloudBlobContainer** object to create a blob from the image data array and the metadata properties.

	The code retrieves metadata from the text controls and from properties in the **asp:FileUpload** control on the page, which include the content type of the posted file, its file name, and the array of bytes containing the image data. It then calls the **SaveImage** method to store the image and its metadata to Windows Azure storage. 

1. Press **F5** to build and run the application and open the image gallery page in a browser window.

1. Enter metadata in the **Name**, **Description** and **Tags** text boxes. To select the image file, click **Browse**, navigate to **\\Source\\Assets\\Images**, and select one of the available images.

#### Task 3 – Retrieving Metadata for Blobs in Storage ####

Blobs can have metadata attached to them. Metadata headers can be set on a request that creates a new container or blob resource, or on a request that explicitly creates a property on an existing resource. In this task, you will add functionality to the image gallery page to retrieve and display metadata associated with images stored in a Windows Azure container.

1. Add an event handler to retrieve metadata for each blob displayed in the list view control that displays images. To do this, go to **Default.aspx**, right-click **View Designer**, select the **images ListView** control, and in the **Properties** Window (you may need to make it visible by right-clicking the control and choosing Properties) click the **Events** button. Locate the **ItemDataBound** event in the Data category, type **OnBlobDataBound** and press **ENTER**. Alternatively, you may edit the ASP.NET markup directly to insert the required event handler.

	_Configuring the event handler to display metadata_
	
1. In the code-behind file, locate the **OnBlobDataBound** method and insert the following code (shown in **bold**) that retrieves the properties for each blob bound to the list view and creates a collection that contains name / value pairs for each metadata item found. The collection is then used as a data source for an **asp:Repeater** control that displays metadata for each image.

#### Task 6 – Taking Blob Snapshots ####

Windows Azure Blob service has support for taking snapshots of blobs. The different between a snapshot and a copy is that snapshots are read-only and the original blob maintains a relationship to its snapshots; blob copies on the other hand are editable. Once a snapshot has been taken for a blob, this source blob can no longer be deleted. Before a source blob can be deleted, all of its snapshots must be deleted first.

In this task, you add functionality to take a snapshot of a blob that contains image data from Windows Azure storage.

1. Update the image list view to add an **asp:LinkButton** control that is used to snapshot images from the gallery container. Open the **Default.aspx** page in Source mode and locate the **ItemTemplate** for the images **asp:ListView** control. Uncomment the ASP.NET markup located immediately following the copy blob link button control (shown in **bold**).

### Exercise 4: Working with Drives ###
	
A Windows Azure Drive is an NTFS formatted virtual hard disk (VHD) file that is stored in a page blob. You can mount this VHD into a Windows Azure Compute instance to provide persistent storage exposed to applications via the Windows file system. The content of an Azure Drive will persist even if the compute role to which it is mounted is recycled.

In this exercise, you take an existing application that makes use of regular Windows file system APIs to access information in local disk storage and run it as a Windows Azure service.  You will see that by using a Windows Azure Drive, no changes to the code are necessary to run the same application in the Azure cloud and have it access information stored in Azure storage.

In the first part of the exercise, you execute the original application in the ASP.NET development server to familiarize yourself with its operation. Next, you create a cloud service project, associate the application as a Web role, and run it in the compute emulator using simulated Azure Drives. Finally, you create a VHD on your local machine, upload it to blob storage, deploy the application to Windows Azure and mount the drive in a Windows Azure instance.
	
<a name="Ex4Task1" />
#### Task 1 - Exploring the PhotoAlbum Application####

PhotoAlbum is a sample application that uses standard file system APIs to obtain a directory listing of the contents of its image store. In this task, you briefly examine the application and then configure the location of the image store to a folder in your machine to run the application locally.

1. Open Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 in elevated administrator mode. To do this, in **Start** | **All Programs** | **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010**, right-click the **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010** shortcut and choose **Run as administrator**. 

	> **Note:** You are not required to use elevated administrator mode to run the application using the ASP.NET Web development server. However, you will need to do this later, when you launch the application in the compute emulator.

1. If the **User Account Control** dialog appears, click **Continue**.

1. Open the begin solution provided for this exercise. In the **File** menu, choose **Open Project**. Then, in the **Open Project** dialog, navigate to **\\Source\\Ex4-WorkingWithDrives\\begin** and open the **PhotoAlbum.sln** solution.

1.	Take a minute to browse the files in the application. First, double-click **Default.aspx** in **Solution Explorer** to open this file. Notice that the page uses a **GridView** control to display a directory listing of the image store and that its data source is a **LinqDataSource** control bound to a **PhotoAlbumDataSource** context object.

1.	Next, open the **PhotoAlbumDataSource.cs** file to examine the context object class used by the **LinqDataSource**.  Notice that the **Files** property used by the data source control returns a collection of [FileInfo][7] objects and that it uses standard file system APIs to enumerate PNG and JPEG files in the image store directory. 

[7]:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.fileinfo.aspx

1. Now, open the **Global.asax** file and see that it contains an **ImageStorePath** property that returns the location of the image store folder and that the **Application_Start** event handler initializes this property with a path that it retrieves from the application settings.

1. Before you run the application, you need to configure the location of the image store. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **Web.config** to open this file in the text editor. In the **appSettings** section, locate the _ImageStorePath_ setting and update its value to the path of the **Sample Pictures** folder in your machine.

	![Configuring the location of the image store](images/configuring-the-location-of-the-image-store.png?raw=true)

	_Configuring the location of the image store_


	> **Note:** The sample pictures library is typically available in most Windows installations and is located at “_%PUBLIC%\Pictures\Sample Pictures”_. It contains a small set of image files. If this folder is not available in your environment, you may substitute it with any folder that contains a suitable collection of JPEG or PNG image files, for example, those found in _Assets\Images_ in the _Source_ folder of this lab.

	> Note that _%PUBLIC%_ is an environment variable that points to the location of _Public_ in the User profiles folder. You must expand the variable to the proper value when you configure the _ImageStorePath_ setting (e.g. _C:\\Users\\Public\\Pictures\\Sample Pictures_).

1. Press **F5** to build and run the PhotoAlbum application. Notice that the default page shows a listing of the files contained in the image store. Also, notice that the path to the image store is the folder on your machine that you set up in the application configuration file.

	>**Note:** Make sure the cloud project is set as the startup project by right-clicking it in **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Set as StartUp Project**.

	![Running the PhotoAlbum application locally ](images/running-the-photoalbum-application-locally.png?raw=true)

	_Running the PhotoAlbum application locally_

1. Close the browser window. You have now seen that the application uses standard file system APIs to access the files in its store. In the next task, you will update the application to run as a cloud service.

<a name="Ex4Task2" />
#### Task 2 - Using a Windows Azure Drive to Move the Application to the Cloud####

When moving the application to Windows Azure, the natural choice is to relocate the image store to blob storage. Regardless, the application expects its images to be stored in the file system. You can always update the code that accesses the images in the store and change it to use the Blob service APIs instead. For a simple application such as this one, this would not be too challenging, but it can represent a barrier for a more complex application. Using Windows Azure Drives enables you to move the application to the cloud without any changes to its code, other than mounting the drive on a page blob.

In this task, you update the application to run as a Windows Azure cloud service and to use a Windows Azure Drive for its image store.

1. Add a cloud service project to the solution. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the root solution node, point to **Add** and then select **New Project**. 

1. In the **Add** **New Project** dialog, expand **Visual C#** in the **Installed Templates** list and select **Cloud**. Choose the **Windows Azure Project** template, set the **Name** of the project to **PhotoAlbumService**, leave the proposed location unchanged and then click **OK**.

	![Creating a Windows Azure Project ](images/creating-a-windows-azure-project.png?raw=true)

	_Creating a Windows Azure Project_

1. In the **New Windows Azure Project** dialog, click **OK** without adding any new roles. You will use the existing application as a web role.

1. Add a reference to the Windows Azure support assemblies. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **PhotoAlbum** project and select **Add Reference**. In the **Add Reference** dialog, switch to the **.NET** tab, select the **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.CloudDrive**, **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Diagnostics**, **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime**, and **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient** assemblies, and then click **OK**.

	![Adding a reference to the Windows Azure support assemblies](images/adding-a-reference-to-the-windows-azure-suppo.png?raw=true)

	_Adding a reference to the Windows Azure support assemblies_

	
1. Now, in **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Roles** node in the **PhotoAlbumService** project, point to **Add** and then select **Web Role Project in solution**.

1. In the **Associate with Role Project** dialog, select the **PhotoAlbum** project and click **OK**.

1. You will now configure the web role. To do this, double-click the **PhotoAlbum** role under the **Roles** node in the **PhotoAlbumService** project.

1. In the **PhotoAlbum \[Role\]** properties window, switch to the **Settings** tab and then click **Add Setting**. Set the **Name** of the new setting to _DataConnectionString_, set the **Type** as _Connection String_, and then click the button labeled with an ellipsis located on the right side of the **Value** column. In the **Storage Connection String** dialog, choose the option labeled **Use storage emulator** and click **OK**.

1. Add a second setting to configure the URL of the cloud drive in blob storage. For this setting, set the **Name** to _ImageStoreBlobUri_, the **Type** as _String_, and the **Value** as _mydrives/SamplePictures.vhd_. 

	> **Note:** The _ImageStoreBlobUri_ setting identifies a Blob service URI and is case sensitive. Make sure that you enter the value exactly as shown.

	![Configuring the Web role settings](images/configuring-the-web-role-settings.png?raw=true)

	_Configuring the Web role settings_

1. Switch to the **Local Storage** tab and then click **Add Local Storage**. Set the **Name** of the new storage setting to _LocalDriveCache_, set the **Size** to _120_ and leave **Clean on Role Recycle** unselected.

	![Configuring local storage for the Web role to cache Azure drive contents](images/configuring-local-storage-for-the-web-role-to.png?raw=true)

	_Configuring local storage for the Web role to cache Azure drive contents_

	> **Note:** When **Clean on Role Recycled** is disabled, the contents of the cache will persist even if the role instance is recycled.
	
	> Due to the way that the system allocates local storage resources, part of the requested space is unavailable for cache usage. Beginning with Windows Azure Guest OS 1.8, the entire Windows Azure Drive cache is allocated up-front and if there is not enough space in the local resource for the cache, the call to Mount will fail. To avoid this issue when configuring the size of the local resource destined for the drive cache, specify an additional 20MB to the required size. For example, to use a 1000MB cache size, set the size of the local resource to 1020MB.

	
1. Press **CTRL+S** to save the changes to the role configuration.

1. Configure a trace listener to output diagnostics information to the Windows Azure log. To do this, double-click **Web.config** in **Solution Explorer** to open this file and insert the following **system.diagnostics** section into the configuration, as shown below.

	(Code Snippet - _ExploringStorage-Ex4-01-DiagnosticMonitorTraceListener_)

1. Add a class to the Web role project to manage its initialization and shutdown. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **PhotoAlbum** project, point to **Add** and then select **Existing Item**. In the **Add Existing Item** dialog, browse to **Ex4-WorkingWithDrives\Assets**, select **WebRole.cs** and then click **Add**.

	> **Note:** The **WebRole.cs** file contains a standard **RoleEntryPoint** derived class, similar to the one generated when you select a new Windows Azure Web Role project template in Visual Studio.


1. Locate the **Application_Start** method in **Global.asax.cs** file and insert the following code (shown in **bold**) to this method.

	>**Note:** The preceding code checks if it has already mounted a second drive and if not, it creates a new NTFS formatted cloud drive and its associated page blob. It then copies the contents of the originally mounted drive into this second drive. If the drive already exists, it first unmounts it and then deletes it.

1. Finally, add an event handler for the **SelectedIndexChanged** event of the mounted drives drop down list. To do this, insert the following method into the **_Default** class.

#### Task 4 - Creating an NTFS Formatted VHD on Your Local Machine####

So far, you have explored Windows Azure Drives using the simulated environment provided by the compute emulator. When you deploy the application to the Windows Azure environment, you need a mechanism to upload the information used by the application to blob storage. One alternative is creating a Virtual Hard Drive (VHD) locally in your machine, copying the required information, and then uploading the VHD file to a Windows Azure page blob.

In this task, you create an NTFS-formatted VHD file to contain sample images that you can upload to Windows Azure Storage and then use as the backing store for a Windows Azure Drive.

>**Note:** This task is optional and is dependent on a feature that is currently available only in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. If you do not have these operating system versions, you may skip this task and use the pre-built VHD included in the lab's _Assets_ folder instead.
 
>**Important:** To complete the remaining tasks in this exercise, you require a valid Windows Azure subscription.

	_Uploading a VHD file to a Windows Azure page blob_

1. Now that you have uploaded the VHD file to Azure Storage, you are now ready to deploy the application.

1. Switch back to Visual Studio.

1. First, you need to update the web role configuration with your storage account information. To do this, expand the **Roles** node in the **PhotoAlbumService** project and double-click the **PhotoAlbum** role to open its properties window. 

1. In the **PhotoAlbum \[Role\]** window, switch to the **Settings** tab, locate the _Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString_ setting and then click the button labeled with an ellipsis, on the right edge of the row. In the **Storage Connection String** dialog, choose **Enter Storage Credentials** and enter the **Account name** and **Account key** for your Windows Azure storage account. In the **Connection** area, make sure that the **Use default HTTPS endpoints** option is selected, and click **OK**.

1. Repeat the previous step to configure the _DataConnectionString_ setting. Enter the same information used previously except for the **Connection** setting, which should be set to **Use default HTTP endpoints**.

	_Configuring the storage account for the cloud drive to use HTTP endpoints_

	> **Note:** Windows Azure Drives only support HTTP endpoints currently.

1. Now that you have configured the application with the settings for your storage account, you can proceed to deploy it. To create a service package, right-click the **PhotoAlbumService** cloud service project and select **Package**. 

	>**Note:** For additional information about deploying your application to Windows Azure, see the **Windows Azure Deployment** hands-on lab in this training kit. In particular, Exercise 3 of this lab discusses deploying applications from Visual Studio.

	![Creating a service package in Visual Studio](images/creating-a-service-package-in-visual-studio.png?raw=true)

	_Creating a service package in Visual Studio_

1. In the **Package Windows Azure Application** dialog box, click **Package** to generate the package. This opens Windows Explorer to a folder within your solution folders that contains the generated package. Although you could use the integrated deployment feature in the Windows Azure Tools to publish the service to Windows Azure directly from Visual Studio, in this lab, you deploy it using the Windows Azure Management Portal.

1. To deploy the service package, go to the [Management Portal][10] and sign in. 

[10]:https://manage.windowsazure.com/

1. At the portal, select the project where you will deploy your application. If you have not previously created a service, you will need to create one at this time; otherwise, you may use an existing service. In that case, skip the following steps and go directly to step 20. 

1. Create the compute component that executes the application code. To do this, click **New** | **Cloud Service** | **Custom Create**.

	![Creating a new cloud service](images/creating-a-new-cloud-service.png?raw=true "Creating a new cloud service")

	_Creating a new cloud service_

1. In the **Create a cloud service** dialog, select a unique **URL** prefix for your service and then choose an available **Region/Affinity Group** from the list.

1. Select **Deploy a Cloud Service package now** and continue to the next step.

	![Create Your Cloud Service](images/create-your-cloud-service.png?raw=true "Create Your Cloud Service")

	_Create a cloud service_

1. In the **Publish your cloud service** page, select a **Deployment Name** and then, select the Package (**.cspkg**) and Configuration (**.cscfg**) files that you generated in Visual Studio: you can find them in the file system location indicated by the Windows Explorer window that opened when you published the package.

1. Finally, set the **Environment** where you want to deploy the application (_Production_ or _Staging_), select **Deploy even if one or more reoles contain a single instance** and finish the wizard.

	![Publish your cloud service](images/publish-your-cloud-service.png?raw=true "Publish your cloud service")

	_Publish your cloud service_


	> **Note:** A Windows Azure virtual machine runs a guest operating system into which your service application is deployed. To support the Windows Azure Drive feature, the operating system version must be compatible with the Windows Azure SDK version 1.7. For information on available versions of the Windows Azure guest operating system, see [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee924680(v=MSDN.10).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee924680\(v=MSDN.10\).aspx).
	
	> In general, it is recommended to use the latest available OS to take advantage of new features and security fixes. If you do not specify a version in your configuration file, the OS upgrade method is set to automatic and Windows Azure automatically upgrades your VMs to the latest release of the guest OS, once it becomes available. For this lab, you will not choose a specific version and instead use automatic upgrade mode to ensure that the application runs under a guest OS that supports Windows Azure Drives.


1. Wait for the transfer to complete. The status of the service should show **Ready** when completed.

1. Now, click **URL** link within your recently deployed service to open the application in your browser. The application should behave in essentially the same manner as it did when you deployed it locally. However, notice that the URL of the page blob for the mounted drive is now pointing to the page blob where you uploaded the VHD file.

## Summary ##

In this lab, you have learned how to work with the Windows Azure Storage using tables, blobs, queues and drives.

Tables store data as collections of entities. Entities are similar to rows. An entity has a primary key and a set of properties. A property is a name/value pair, similar to a column.

Blobs can store any binary data. In this lab, you have used the Blob service to store and show images and associate metadata using a Web application.

Using queues, you have seen how to dispatch simple messages (with string, xml or binary content). This is an excellent way of enabling communication between web and worker roles.

Finally, you explored the use of Windows Azure Drives that allow you to read and write data to blob storage using standard file system functions.
